"""Fail if a commit since BASE uses a retired identity or AI attribution.

  uv run scripts/check-commit-identity.py BASE [HEAD]

Repo split spec §5.10 and §5.11.3: since the phase 1 history rewrite,
the maintainer's commits are authored `FasterSpeeding
<lucy@cursed.solutions>`, and no commit message carries Claude
attribution. For each commit in BASE..HEAD (HEAD defaults to `HEAD`)
this fails (exit 1) when:

  - its author or committer address is one of the retired addresses: the
    maintainer's two old ones, or Claude's noreply. The old addresses are
    matched by SHA-256 so they are not written down here (§5.11.3: no
    file but the spec names them);
  - a message line is one of the attribution lines the rewrite strips: a
    `Co-authored-by:` trailer with an @anthropic.com address, a
    `Claude-Session:` trailer pointing at claude.ai, or a "Generated with
    Claude Code" footer.

Any other identity passes: an outside contributor's commits keep their
own author, as do Renovate's, and GitHub stays the committer of web
merges. Mentions of Claude that are product content (the connector, the
enricher's Anthropic provider) are not attribution and pass.

CI runs it on every pull request (BASE: the merge base with the target
branch, HEAD: the PR's head) and push (BASE: the pre-push commit). Run it
before pushing a branch:
  uv run scripts/check-commit-identity.py "$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)"

Findings are GitHub Actions `::error::` lines on stdout. A git failure
(e.g. an unknown BASE) exits with git's status. Stdlib only.
